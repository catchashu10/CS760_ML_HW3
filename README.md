CS 760 Machine Learning Homework 3 code.

Hello!
This repository contains the implementation of CS760 Machine learning Homework 3 implementation.

I have implemented the assignment using the Jupyter libraray and all the codes for building the logistic regression, kNN, generating data and plots for the follow up questions are present in the *CS760_ML_HW3.ipynb* file. The repository also contains the given D2z.txt and emails.csv files as well. 

To run the code simply load the *CS760_ML_HW3.ipynb* file to your Jupyter notebook and follow the instructions on the notebook comments.
